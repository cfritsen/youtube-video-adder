# youtube-video-adder
A simple module built with React that adds YouTube videos to the page from the video URL.

Copy and paste a URL for the YouTube video into the form and hit Submit. This will add the video to the page.
Do it again and it will add a second video.

Known bugs: Sometimes the video height doesn't scale properly, and the Start Time parameter YouTube sometimes adds to the end of the URL will cause YouTube errors.
